Our department is dedicated to unraveling the molecular mechanisms that maintain genomic integrity — the essential state of DNA that underpins cell health and prevents disease. The primary research objective is to elucidate how unscheduled conflicts between DNA replication and transcription (TRCs) associated with R-loop formation act as major sources of DNA replication stress within both cancerous and non-cancerous cellular environments and how cells defend against such events. We seek to identify factors that confer cells’ susceptibility to TRCs and R-loops and determine if these factors can be therapeutically exploited to enhance the efficacy and mitigate the adverse effects of current cancer treatments.
To achieve these goals, we utilize 2D and 3D cellular models. Our methodological approach integrates diverse in vitro assays, such as the DNA fiber spreading and high-throughput microscopy, as well as state-of-the-art methodology, including advanced DNA sequencing methods and proteomics.
