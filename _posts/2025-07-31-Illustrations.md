Minimalist illustration in Adobe Illustrator to easily communicate ideas or to make my friends smile.
The beggining was in drawing reaction schemes and mechanisms in organic chemistry on the paper and in software for chemical drawing (Chemsketch, ChemBioDraw, Marvin). I draw my first scientific cartoon in 2016 in Powerpoint and I had my first access to Adobe Illustrator (and Photoshop) in 2018/2019 at Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Czech Academy of Sciences. I was very lucky, because I became friend with super creative members of Pavel Jansčák subgroup, who had been already skilled with the software. :-) Their heartwarming artwork became my inspiration and motivation. Nevertheless, I met very talented people with great ideas during my academic carreer and my art work improved thanks to them ... (e.g. Edu alias Artkemystic: @artkemystic_science). My inspiration mostly originates from research and rearched groups I follow and daily life (struggles).
