### Inhibitor treatment and release in mitosis
(10-12 h, + 30 mins the next day)

* total cell concentration should be 1-3 x 10<sup>7</sup> cells per flask 
* add a final concentration of 2 µM of 1NM-PP1 to the cells (should not be more than 6-7 x 10<sup>5</sup> cells/mL)
* incubate cells for 10-12 hours at 39 °C with 5 % CO2
* to release the cells in mitosis wash twice at RT with prewarmed medium (1300 rpm; 5 min) 
* resuspend cells in fresh media (no more than 1 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL) and incubate at 39 °C with 5 % CO2  (T = 0 min)
* take a sample of different timepoints (7.5 min or 10 min after release)

>Idea<br>
to try three samples as it is and one more ctrl (if possible) without permeabilization and blocking: should work as well in this case.

### Preparation of coverslips 
(approx. 1h + 1h drying)

* wash with EtOH, and clean them with KIMTECH tissue;
* *optional:* wash with milliQ H<sub>2</sub>O 
* KOH (1 M; 15 min; r.t.) 
* rinse properly with plenty of H2O: 2x destilated from pipes; 1x milliQ H<sub>2</sub>O 
* PLL coating: for bigger cover slips (200 µL; 5 min; on parafilm in wet chamber)
* wash: 3x PBS (5min+ pipet up and down 3times/each)
* dry (r.t., approx. 1 h)


### Harvest cells 
(approx. 2h – during drying step of PLL)

* add EdU to cells of interest to final concentration of 10 µM (10 mM stock; 30 min; 37 °C)
    * add directly to media and slowly shake properly
* harvest cells / count cells as usual 
    * ***IF:*** 5 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells
    * ***FACS:*** 5 × 10<sup>6</sup>  cells (0.5 × 10<sup>6</sup> - 1 × 10<sup>6</sup>  could be enough)
    * ***total in one Eppendorf:*** 1-3 x 10<sup>7</sup> cells
* fixation: (pre-warmed) PFA/PBS (4% ; 10 min)
* wash cells twice in PBS (1500 rpm; 4 min)
    * (second time leave PBS and cells at 4°C until staining, do not spin down pelet)


>DT40 cells<br>
Use TBS instead of PBS


### Staining 
(approx. 2h)

!!! all centrifuging steps: Centrifuge at 1500 rpm; 4 min (*Optional:* 500 g; 5 min)
       Add 1% BSA before centrifugation (more than 1 volume); after permeabilization, to keep cells down!!!

* 1x centrifuge, remove supernatant;
* permeabilization: Triton X-100 (1 mL; 0.5 % Triton X-100; 15 min) 
* add PBS (1 mL; w/ BSA)
* 1x centrifuge, remove supernatant;
* optional: add PBS (1mL; w/ BSA), 1x centrifuge
* blocking: 1 % BSA in PBS (500 µL; 15 - 30 min; if click-it reaction w/o N<sub>3-</sub>)<br>

* Click-reaction (100 µl per sample)
    * Master mix : Reagents for 5 samples (prepare master mix in the order below)

    1. sterile or milliQ H<sub>2</sub>O:		398 µL (up to 500 µL)
    1. Tris (1M; pH 8.2, 10x):		50 µL - we used pH 7.92 should be ~8 
    1. CuSO4 (500x; 1 M):		    1 µL
    1. ascorbate (10x ):		    50 µL (frozen aliquots in -20, ascorbate)
    1. Alexa 647/488-Azide (500x):	1 µL<br>

* add 100 µl per sample and incubate 30-60 min at r.t.
* optional: wash with PBS after the click reaction 

* add 1 µg/ml DAPI (stock 1 mg/ml = 200x) in PBS – 180 µl (100-200 µl) per sample, mix by pipetting
* *optional:* Hoechst (should work as well)

* add appropriate volume of cells on to coverslips
* measure FACS from the rest: add PBS up to 500 – 1 000 µL

>NOTE:<br>
If the size of cell pellet is an issue: after spinning out Alexa, pellet can be resuspended directly in DAPI/PBS and it can be immediately submitted to FACS analysis.
