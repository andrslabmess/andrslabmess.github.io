description: FACS analysis for γH2AX/pH3 vs. EdU vs. DAPI
---


All centrifugations: 5’ @450g, 4°C. One can use 1.5 ml or FACS tubes for the staining – for staining or pre-extracted cells, I always use FACS tubes because it is easier to decant the supernatant after spinning.


### Protocol

1. EdU only: Add EdU to cells of interest to final concentration of 10µM (10mM stock)
1. Incubate 30’@37°C
1. Harvest cells by trypsinisation
1. Wash cells with 1x PBS (Eppendorf centrifuge 5810R: 450xg)
1. RPA only: pre-extract by incubating the cells in 100 µl 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS for 10’ on ice
1. RPA only: Add PBS to 1 ml and spin down
1. Incubate cells in 300 µl 4% FA/PBS for 15’ at RT
1. Add 1% BSA/PBS to 1 ml and spin down
1. Wash with 1 ml 1% BSA/PBS
1. Decant supernatant, resuspend cells in 1 ml 1% BSA/PBS, store @4°C – PROCESS SAMPLES THE SAME DAY OR THE DAY AFTER
1. Split cells into sample tubes, in case you do multiple staining on the same sample. Spin down
1. Resuspend cells in 100µl saponin buffer containing 1° antibodies: <br>
Mouse α-γH2AX 1:2000<br>
Rabbit α-γH2AX 1:500<br>
Mouse α-MPM2 1:1000<br>
Mouse α-RPA 1:50<br>
Rabbit α-pH3 1:133<br>
Using FACS tubes; decant the supernatant and a little bit of buffer remains in the tube. In this case, I add 50µl of buffer containing 2x antibody.
1. 2hrs @RT
1. Add saponin buffer to 0.5 ml and spin down
1. Wash with 0.5 ml saponin buffer
1. Resuspend cells in 50 µl saponin buffer containing appropriate 2° antibodies:<br>
Alexa 647 1:50 (FACS channel APC) choose colors according to your FACS!!!<br>
Alexa 750 1:50 (FACS channel APC-Cy7)<br>
Alexa 488 1:50 (FACS channel FITC)<br>
Using FACS tubes, I decant the supernatant and a little bit of buffer remains in the tube. In this case, I add 25µl of buffer containing 2x antibody.
1. 30’ @RT in the dark
1. Add saponin buffer to 0.5 ml and spin down
1. Wash with 0.5 ml saponin buffer<br>
<br>
1. EdU only: Resuspend EdU-labelled cells in ClickIT reaction mix (100 µl/sample):<br>
87.5 µl	1X ClickIT Reaction Buffer or PBS <br>
2 µl	CuSO4<br>
0.5 µl 	A488 azide (FACS channel FITC)<br>
10 µl	Buffer Additive (dilute 10x solution in H20, then take 10 µl)<br>
100 µl	final volume<br>
<br>
1. EdU only: 30’ @RT in the dark
1. EdU only: Add 1% BSA/PBS to 1 ml and spin down 
1. EdU only: Wash with 1 ml 1% BSA/PBS
1. Resuspend cells in 0.5 ml 1% BSA/PBS containing 0.1mg/ml RNase and 1µg/ml DAPI (FACS channel Violet 1)
1. 15-30’ @RT in the dark… and measure!
