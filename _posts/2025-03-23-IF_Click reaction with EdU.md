# Immunofluorescence

## Material

### Pre-extraction buffers
[CSK (cytoskeletal) buffer]({% link _posts/2025-03-23-IF_General protocol and pre-extraction.md %})

### Fixing solution

4 % formaldehyde (PFA) in PBS

### Blocking solution

3 % BSA in PBS <br>
Filter sterilize, before each usage inspect the solution for contamination. Filter again is necessary

### Click reaction for EdU

|for 500 μL               |     
|:-----------------------|
|390 μL H2O               |
|50 μL Tris.HCl pH 8      |
|10 μL 100mM CuSO4        |
|50 μL 1M Sodium Ascorbate|
|0.5 μL Alexa-azid        |


## Protocol
### Cell seeding

1. insert sterile coverslips in dishes/well plates
1. seed the cells to have apporx. 70 % confluency the next day
1. add dox or other 24h treatments, if necessary

### Click reaction: + fixation without CSK buffer pre-extraction

1. if the cells are seeded onto dish: transfer coverslips with cells into multiwell plate with pre-warm medium
1. EdU staining: add EdU (final conc 20 μM; for 15 min) 
1. wash cells with r.t. 1x PBS
1. fix the cells with 500 uL fixing solution, leave for 15 min r.t. in the chemical hood
1. wash coverslips 3 times with 1x PBS
1. permeabilize coverslips with 0.2 % Triton-X in PBS for 10 min, r.t.
1. wash coverslips 2x wit 1x PBS

### Click reaction: + fixation with CSK buffer pre-extraction

[Pre-extraction buffers]({% link _posts/2025-03-23-IF_General protocol and pre-extraction.md %})

1. optional: transfer coverslips with cells into multiwell plate
1. treat the cells, for EdU staining add 20 μM of EdU for 15 min
1. wash cells with r.t. 1x PBS
1. add 500 uL of ice-cold pre-extraction buffer and leave it on ice for 5 or 10 minutes
1. wash the cells with ice-cold preextraction buffer without Triton-X
1. fix the cells with 500 μL fixing solution, leave for 15 min r.t. in the chemical hood
1. wash coverslips 3 times with 1x PBS
1. when staining PCNA: fix the cells addditionally with -20°C methanol (20 min at -20°C); wash 3x with 1x PBS

### Staining

*In humid (dark) chamber:* 
1. transfer coverslips into a humid chamber, cells facing up. 
1. quickly add 100 uL 3% BSA in PBS on top of the coverslip, leave for 15 min, r.t. to block the cells. Avoid drying up of coverslips
1. wash coverslips 1x with 1xPBS, 1x with blocking solution
1. add primary antibodies, 50 uL on top of a coverslip, keep for 90 min in dark
1. wash coverslips 3 times with 1x PBS, roughly 200 uL
1. add secondary antibodies, 50 μL on top of a coverslip, keep for 30-60 min in dark
1. wash with 1x PBS
1. stain with DAPI, 1:2000 (1 μg/ml)
