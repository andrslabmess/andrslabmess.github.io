# Immunofluorescence

## Material

### Fixing solution

4 % formaldehyde in PBS

### Blocking solution

3 % BSA in PBS <br>
Filter sterilize, before each usage inspect the solution for contamination. Filter again is necessary

### Click reaction for EdU

|for 500 uL               |     
|:-----------------------|
|390 uL H2O               |
|50 uL Tris.HCl pH 8      |
|10 uL 100mM CuSO4        |
|50 uL 1M Sodium Ascorbate|
|0.5 uL Alexa-azid        |


## Protocol
### Cell seeding

1. Insert sterile coverslips in dishes/well plates
1. Seed the cells to have apporx. 70 % confluency the next day
1. Add dox or other 24h treatments, if necessary

### Cell treatment and harvest without pre-extraction

1. If the cells are seeded onto dish: transfer coverslips with cells into multiwell plate with pre-warm medium
1. Treat the cells, for EdU staining add 20 uM of EdU for 15 min
1. Wash cells with r.t. 1x PBS
1. Fix the cells with 500 uL fixing solution, leave for 15 min r.t. in the chemical hood
1. Wash coverslips 3 times with 1x PBS
1. Permeabilize coverslips with 0.2 % Triton-X in PBS for 10 min, r.t.
1. Wash coverslips 2x wit 1x PBS

### Cell treatment and harvest without pre-extraction

1. If necessary, transfer coverslips with cells into multiwell plate
1. Treat the cells, for EdU staining add 20 uM of EdU for 15 min
1. Wash cells with r.t. 1x PBS
1. Add 500 uL of ice-cold pre-extraction buffer and leave it on ice for 5 or 10 minutes
1. Wash the cells with ice-cold preextraction buffer without Triton-X
1. Fix the cells with 500 uL fixing solution, leave for 15 min r.t. in the chemical hood
1. Wash coverslips 3 times with 1x PBS
1. When staining PCNA, fix the cells addditionally with -20C methanol. Put in a freezer for 20 min and then wash 3x with 1x PBS

### Staining

1. Preapare a humid chamber. It should be covered with aluminium foil to block the light, inside have a parafilm on a flat surface
1. Transfer coverslips into a humid chamber, on parafilm with cells up. 
1. Quickly add 100 uL 3% BSA in PBS on top of the coverslip, leave for 15 min, r.t. to block the cells. Avoid drying up of coverslips
1. If necessary, perform click-reaction with 50 uL, keep in dark
1. After click reaction, wash coverslips 1x with 1xPBS, 1x with blocking solution
1. Add primary antibodies, 50 uL on top of a coverslip, keep for 90 min in dark
1. Wash coverslips 3 times with 1x PBS, roughly 200 uL
1. Add secondary antibodies, 50 uL on top of a coverslip, keep for 30-60 min in dark
1. Wash with 1x PBS
1. Stain with DAPI, 1:2000 (1 ug/ml)
